=============

Arena for playing around w/ Android

Project name derived from "Why so serious" quote of Dark Knight.

Following lists some of the features for this application
* Music player that allows customizable shuffling of the musics 
  * For instance let's say there exists 1000 musics and one sets the partition to 4, allowing 250 in each partition. 
  * Then one can set the weight distribution to something like 2:1:1:1 using the customized view of canvas graph to allow the first partition [i.e. recently added music] to have 2/5 probability of being chosen while others have 1/5. 
* Move move
  * To store emails and accounts tied to them and to store them in db; for instance when one has to move and update all the addresses [unfortunately no known API from bank and etc to change address on the fly]
